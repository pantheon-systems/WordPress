### 3. Run the WordPress installer

How about the WordPress database config screen? No need to worry about database connection information as that is taken care of in the background. The only step that you need to complete is the site information and the installation process will be complete.

We will post more information about how this works but we recommend developers take a look at `wp-config.php` to get an understanding.

If you would like to keep a separate set of configuration for local development, you can use a file called `wp-config-local.php`, which is already in our .gitignore file.

### 4. Enjoy!
