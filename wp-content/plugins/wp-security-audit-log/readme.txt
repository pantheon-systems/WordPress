#### WordPress Changes & Details the Plugin Keeps a Log Of
If you are looking for a comprehensive & complete WordPress activity log solution you are in the right place. The WP Security Audit Log plugin does not just tell you that a post, a user profile or an object was updated. It reports what was changed within the post, profile or object in real time.

* **Post, Page and Custom Post Type changes** such as status, content, title, URL, date and custom field changes

* **Tags and Categories changes** such as creating, modifying or deleting them, and adding or removing them from posts

* **Widgets and Menus changes** such as creating, modifying or deleting them

* **User changes** such as user created or registered, deleted or added to a site on multisite network

* **User profile changes** such as password, email, display name and role changes

* **User activity** such as login, logout, failed logins and terminating other sessions

* **WordPress core and settings changes** such as installed updates, permalinks, default role, URL and other site-wide changes

* **WordPress multisite network changes** such as adding, deleting or archiving sites, adding or removing users from sites etc

* **Plugins and Themes changes** such as installing, activating, deactivating, uninstalling and updating them

* **WordPress database changes** such as when a plugin adds or removes a table

* **Changes on BBPress forums**, **WooCommerce Stores and Products** and other popular WordPress plugins.

For every change the plugin keeps record of it also reports the:
