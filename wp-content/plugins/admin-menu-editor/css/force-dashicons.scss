/*
 Forcibly set menu icons to the selected custom Dashicons.

 Problem:
 Some plugins use CSS to assign icons to their admin menu items. Users want to change the icons.
 In many cases, simply changing the icon URL doesn't work because the plugin CSS overrides it.

 Workaround:
 Add more CSS that overrides the icon styles that were set by other plugins.
