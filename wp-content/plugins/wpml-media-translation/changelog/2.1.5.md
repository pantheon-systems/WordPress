# Features
* New way to define plugin url is now tolerant for different server settings

# Fixes
* Fixed media item list in different languages: if some plugin adds its own parameter to URL, lang parameter was not concatenated correctly
* Removed references to global $wp_query in query filtering functions
* When you import posts, WPML created unnecessary media attachments. It is fixed now
