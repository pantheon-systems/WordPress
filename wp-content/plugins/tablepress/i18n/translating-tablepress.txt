TablePress supports the "Translate WordPress" system at https://translate.wordpress.org/.
With that, translating is possible on a website from which so-called Language Packs are
automatically generated and shipped to plugin users.

It is therefore no longer necessary to generate and translate *.po and *.mo files manually.
Instead, just go to https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/tablepress, log in
with a free wordpress.org account and start translating TablePress into your language.

If you want to become a Translation Editor for your language, who can confirm or reject
translation suggestions by other users, please get in touch.

Thank you!
