Improve your speed score on GTmetrix, Pingdom Tools and Google PageSpeed Insights by merging and minifying CSS, JavaScript and HTML, setting up HTTP preload and preconnect headers, loading CSS async and a few more options. 
 

== Description ==

This plugin reduces HTTP requests by merging CSS & Javascript files into groups of files, while attempting to use the least amount of files as possible. It minifies CSS and JS files with PHP Minify (no extra requirements).

There are also options to apply critical CSS and load CSS async, as well as to define HTTP preload and preconnect headers (server push).

Minification is done on the frontend during the first uncached request. Once the first request is processed, any other pages that require the same set of CSS and JavaScript files, will be served that same (static) cache file.

This plugin includes options for developers and advanced users, however the default settings should work just fine for most sites.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I update plugins and themes after installing FVM? =
FVM doesn't touch your original files. It copies those files to the cache directory, minifies that copy and merges them together under a different name. If you install new plugins, change themes or do plugin updates, FVM will purge its cache as well as some of the most popular cache plugins.

= After installing, why did my site feels slow to load? =
Please see the question below.

= Why are there lots of JS and CSS files listed on the status page and why is the cache directory taking so much space? =
Some themes combine and enqueue their CSS using a PHP script with a query string that changes on every pageload... (this is to bust cache, but it's bad practice since it prevents caching at all). When FVM sees a different url being enqueued, it will consider that as a new file and try to create a new set of files on every pageview as well. You must then exclude that dynamic url via the Ignore List on the settings for your cache to be efficient and stop growing. Also note, if your pages enqueue different styles or  javascript in different pages (fairly common), that is "one set" of files to be merged. Pay attention to the logs header and look for the page url where those files have ben generated. If you have multiple files generated for the same url, you have some css/js that keeps changing on every pageview (and thus needs exclusion).


= How can I exclude certain assets? =
Each line on the ignore list will try to match a substring against all CSS or JS files, for example `//yoursite.com/wp-content/plugins/some-plugin/js/` will ignore all files inside that directory. You can also shorten the URL like `/some-plugin/js/` and then it will match any css or js URL that has `/some-plugin/js/` on the path. Obviously, doing `/js/` would match any files inside any "/js/" directory and in any location, so to avoid unexpected situations please always use the longest, most specific path you can use. There is no need to use asterisks or regex code (it won't work).


= Why is the ignore list not working? =
The ignore list "is" working, just try to use partial paths (see previous faq) and use relative urls only without any query vars. 


= Is it compatible with other caching plugins? =
You must disable any features on your theme or cache plugins which perform minification of css, html and js. Double minification not only slows the whole process, but also has the high potential of causing conflicts in javascript. The plugin will try to automatically purge several popular cache plugins, however if you have a cache on the server side (some hosting services have this) you may need to purge it manually, after you purge FVM to see the results you expect. The automatic purge is active for the following plugins and hosting: W3 Total Cache, WP Supercache, WP Rocket, Wp Fastest Cache, Cachify, Comet Cache, Zen Cache, LiteSpeed Cache, Cache Enabler, SG Optimizer, Breeze (Cloudways), Godaddy Managed WordPress Hosting and WP Engine


= Do you recommend a specific Cache Plugin? =
Currently we recommend the "Cache Enabler" plugin, for it's simplicity, compatibility with most systems and performance. Alternatively, W3 Total Cache is a great choice as well.


= Is it resource intensive, or will it use too much CPU on my shared hosting plan? =
Unless you are not excluding dynamic CSS files that change the url in every pageload, its not heavy at all. On the first run, each single file is minified into an intermediate cache. When a new group of CSS/JS files is found on a new page, it reuses those files and merges them into a new static cache file. All pages that request the same group of CSS or JS files will also make use of that file, thus regeneration only happens once. In addition, gz and br files will be pre-compressed (if supported).


= How do I use the pre-compressed files with gzip_static or brotli_static on Nginx? =
When we merge and minify the css and js files, we also create a `.gz` file to be used with `gzip_static` on Nginx. You need to enable this feature on your Nginx configuration file if you want to make use of it. Likewise, if you have Nginx compiled with brotli and have enabled the php-ext-brotli extension for PHP, you can enable the brotli_static option and FVM will also generate .br files for you :)


= Is it compatible with multisites? =
Yes, it generates a new cache file for every different set of JS and CSS requirements it finds, but you must enable and configure FVM settings for each site in your network separatly (no global settings for all sites).


= Is it compatible with AdSense and other ad networks? =
If you are just inserting ads on your pages, yes. If you are using a custom script to inject those ads, please double check if it works. 


= After installing, why are some images and sliders not working? =

a) You cannot do double minification, so make sure you have disabled any features on your theme or other plugins that perform minification of css, html and js files.

b) If you enabled the option to defer JS or CSS, please note that some themes and plugins need jQuery and other libraries to be render blocking, so they are not "undefined" during page load.

c) The plugin relies on PHP Minify to minify JavaScript and css files, however it is not a perfect library and there are plugins that are already minified and do not output a "min.js" or "min.css" filename (and end up being minified again). Try to disable minification on JS and CSS files and purge the cache, then either dequeue it and enqueue an alternative file or add it to the ignore list.

d) Sometimes a plugin conflicts with another when merged (look at google chrome console log for hints). Try to disable CSS processing first and see if it works. Disable JS processing second and see if it works. Try to disable HTML minification last and see if it works. If one of those work, you know there is a conflict when merging/minifying.

e) If you have a conflict, try to add each CSS and each JS file to the ignore list one by one, until you find the one that causes the conflict. If you have no idea of which files to add, check the log file on the "status page" for a list of files being merged into each generated file.

f) If you coded some inline JS code that depends on some JS file being loaded before it's execution, try to save that code into an external file and enqueue it as a dependency. It will be merged together, thus no longer being "undefined".


= Why are some of the CSS and JS files not being merged? =
The plugin only processes JS and CSS files enqueued using the official WordPress api method - https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/including-css-javascript/ -as well as files from the same domain (unless specified on the settings). 


= Can I merge files from other domains? =
Yes and no. You can for example, merge js files such as jQuery if they are loading from a CDN and it will work, because it doesn't matter where those files are being served from. However, stuff like Facebook and other social media widgets, as well as tracking codes, widgets and so on, cannot usually be merged and cached locally as they may load something different on every pageload, or anytime they change something. Ads and widgets make your site slow, so make sure you only use the minimum necessary plugins and widgets.


= How to undo all changes done by the plugin? =
The plugin itself does not do any "changes" to your site and all original files are untouched. It intercepts the enqueued CSS and JS files just before printing your HTML, copies them and enqueues the newly optimized cached version of those files to the frontend. As with any plugin... simply disable or uninstall the plugin, purge all caches you may have in use (plugins, server, cloudflare, etc.) and the site will go back to what it was before installing it. The plugin does not delete anything from the database or modify any of your files. 


= I have disabled or deleted the plugin but my design is still broken! =
Some "cheap" (or sometimes expensive) "optimized" hosting providers, implement a (misconfigured) aggressive cache on their servers that caches PHP code execution and PHP files. I've seen people completely deleting all WordPress files from their host via SFTP/FTP and the website kept working fine for hours. Furthermore, very often they rate limit your cache purge requests... so if you delete FVM and are still seeing references to FVM files on the "view-source:https://example.com" please be patient and contact your web hosting to purge all caches. Providers known to have this issue are some plans on hostgator and iPage (please report others if you find them).


= Why is my Visual Composer or Page Editor not working? =
Some plugins and themes need to edit the layout and styles on the frontend. If you have trouble with page editors, please enable the "Fix Page Editors" option on FVM and purge your caches. Note: You will only see the FVM minification working when you're logged out or using another browser after this setting. 


= What are the recommended cloudflare settings for this plugin? =
On the "Speed" tab, deselect the Auto Minify for JavaScript, CSS and HTML as well as the Rocket Loader option as there is no benefit of using them with our plugin (we already minify things). Those options can also break the design due to double minification or the fact that the Rocket Loader is still experimental (you can read about that on the "Help" link under each selected option on cloudflare).


= How can I load CSS async? =
You are probably a developer if you are trying this. The answer is: make sure FVM is only generating 1 CSS file, because "async" means multiple files will load out of order (however CSS needs order most of the times). If FVM is generating more than 1 CSS file per mediatype, try to manually dequeue some of the CSS files that are breaking the series on FVM (such as external enqueued files), or add their domain to the settings to be merged together. Please note... this is an advanced option for skilled developers. Do not try to fiddle with these settings if you are not one, as it will almost certainly break your site layout and functionality.


= I have a complaint or I need support right now. =
Before getting angry because you have no answer within a few hours (even with paid plugins, sometimes it takes weeks...), please be informed about how wordpress.org and the plugins directory work. The plugins directory is an open source, free service where developers and programmers contribute (on their free time) with plugins that can be downloaded and installed by anyone "at their own risk" and are all released under the GPL license. While all plugins have to be approved and reviewed by the WordPress team before being published (for dangerous code, spam, etc.) this does not change the license or add any warranty. All plugins are provided as they are, free of charge and should be used at your own risk (so you should make backups before installing any plugin or performing updates) and it is your sole responsibility if you break your site after installing a plugin from the plugins directory. For a full version of the license, please read: https://wordpress.org/about/gpl/

= Why haven't you replied to my topic on the support forum yet? =
Support is provided by plugin authors on their free time and without warranty of a reply, so you can experience different levels of support level from plugin to plugin. As the author of this plugin I strive to provide support on a daily basis and I can take a look and help you with some issues related with my plugin, but please note that this is done out of my goodwill and in no way I have any legal or moral obligation for doing this. Sometimes I am extremely busy and may take a few days to reply, but I will always reply. 

= But I really need fast support right now, is there any other way? =
I am also available for hiring if you need custom-made speed optimizations. After you have installed the plugin, check the "Help" tab for contact information, or check my profile links here on WordPress. 


= Where can I report bugs? =
You can get support on the official WordPress plugin page at https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/fast-velocity-minify 
Alternatively, you can reach me via info (at) fastvelocity.com for security or other vulnerabilities.

= How can I donate to the plugin author? =
If you would like to donate any amount to the plugin author (thank you in advance), you can do it via PayPal at https://goo.gl/vpLrSV
