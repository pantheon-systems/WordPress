# EBANX Payment Gateway for WooCommerce

This plugin enables you to integrate your WooCommerce store with the EBANX payment gateway.

Please, visit the [official plugin page on WordPress store](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ebanx-payment-gateway-for-woocommerce/).

## Introduction
We've put together all the information you'll need on this file. Also, we always try to keep this file updated and with as much information as possible. If you want to help us with this file or with any coding issue, we would really appreciate it. :heart:

## Getting Started 

If you want to contribute to our repository the best way is to clone it and then create a symbolic link:

1. Install [WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress) to your prefered location:
	1. With your terminal `cd` into your web root folder:  `cd /path/to/public_html`
	2. Download the latest WordPress build: `wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz`
	3. Unzip the just downloaded file: `tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz`
	4. Delete that file since we don't need it anymore: `rm latest.tar.gz`
	5. Create the Database and a User
	6. Access `http://localhost/wordpress`(it might be different depending on the folder you've downloaded WordPress) and follow its steps.
2. Install [WooCommerce](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/installing-uninstalling-woocommerce/). If you've configured FTP you can access WordPress Admin Dashboard and install it automatically. Otherwise, you can follow these steps:
	1. Go to the plugins folder on your WordPress: `cd /path/to/wordpress/wp-content/plugins`
	2. Download the lastest WooCommerce build: `git clone https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce.git`
	3. Configure it on WordPress Admin Dashboard
3. Clone this repository to your wordpress plugins folder: `cd /path/to/wordpress/wp-content/plugins && git clone https://github.com/ebanx/woocommerce-gateway-ebanx`
4. Let the coding begin!

## Have you found a bug?

You can create a new [Issue](https://github.com/ebanx/woocommerce-gateway-ebanx/issues/new) and wait for someone to fix it. Keep in mind that if you don't provide enough information no one will be able to help you.

## So you want to code...

If you want to code (and you are not an ebanker [yet](https://ebanx.recruiterbox.com/)) all you have to do is fork our repo create a [well named] branch from master and make a [pull request](https://github.com/ebanx/woocommerce-gateway-ebanx/compare) to our master.
