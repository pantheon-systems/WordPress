= I want to add a product attribute to the export  =
Check screenshot #5! You should open section "Set up fields", open section "Products"(right column), click button "Add field", select field in 2nd dropdown, type column title and press button "Confirm".

= I can't filter/export custom attribute for Simple Product =
I'm sorry, but it's impossible. You should add this attribute to Products>Attributes at first and use "Filter by Product Taxonomies".

= Plugin produces unreadable XLS file =
The theme or another plugin outputs some lines. Usually, there are extra empty lines at the end of functions.php(in active theme).

= I can't export Excel file (blank message or error 500) =
Please, increase "memory_limit" upto 256M or ask hosting support to do it.

= How can I add a Gravity Forms field to export? =
Open order, look at items and remember meta name.
Visit WooCommerce>Export Orders,
open section "Set up fields", open section "Products"(at right), click button "Add field",
select SAME name in second dropdown (screenshot #5)

You  should open tab "CSV" and set up ISO-8859-1 as codepage.

It's a normal situation. The plugin hides this warning on successful load.

Yes, you can email a request to aprokaev@gmail.com. We intensively develop this plugin.
