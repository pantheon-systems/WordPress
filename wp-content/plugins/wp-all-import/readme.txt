== Description ==

= WP All Import - Simple & Powerful XML / CSV Importer Plugin =

*“It's a wonderful plugin that does so much, so well that it's hard to list all of the features. But I'll tell you this, I was able to import the content of a pair of websites running the ModX CMS into a WordPress install in less than 30 minutes. No joke!”*  
**Alex Vasquez** - DigiSavvy Co-Founder & WordCamp Los Angeles Organizer

WP All Import has a four step import process and an intuitive drag & drop interface that makes complicated import tasks simple and fast.

There are no special requirements that the elements in your file must be laid out in a certain way. WP All Import really can import any XML or CSV file.

WP All Import can be used for everything from migrating content from a legacy CMS to WordPress to building a store with an affiliate datafeed to displaying live stock quotes or sports scores to building a real estate portal.

Check out our [documentation and video tutorials](http://www.wpallimport.com/documentation/?utm_source=free-plugin&utm_medium=dot-org&utm_campaign=docs) to make the most of WP All Import.

WP All Import integrates with our companion plugin, [WP All Export](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-all-export/). You can export posts, WooCommerce products, orders, users, or anything else with WP All Export. Then you can edit in Excel and re-import to the same site or migrate the data to another site with WP All Import.

*WP All Import Pro* is a paid upgrade that includes premium support and adds the following features:

* Import data to Custom Fields - used by many themes, especially those using Custom Post Types - to store data associated with the posts.

* Import images to the post media gallery - WP All Import can download images from URLs in an XML or CSV file and put them in the media gallery.

* Cron Job/Recurring Imports - WP All Import pro can check periodically check a file for updates, and add, edit, and delete to the imported posts accordingly.

* Import files from a URL - Download and import files from external websites, even if they are password protected with HTTP authentication. URL imports are integrated with the recurring/cron imports feature, so WP All Import can periodically re-download the files and add, edit, and delete posts accordingly.

* Execution of Custom PHP Functions on data, i.e. use something like [my_function({xpath/to/a/field[1]})] in your template, to pass the value of {xpath/to/a/field[1]} to my_function and display whatever it returns.

* Guaranteed technical support via e-mail.

= WordPress CSV Imports =

Read on to learn more about the CSV importer functionality of WP All Import. Importing CSVs with WP All Import is exactly the same as importing XML files, because internally, WP All Import actually converts your CSV file to an XML file on the fly. You can use the same XPath filtering options and all the same features you have when importing XML files.

CSV imports don't require your CSV file to have a specific structure. Your CSV file can use any column names/headings. You can map the columns in your CSV file to the appropriate places in WordPress during the import process.

When importing CSV files, your CSV should have UTF-8 encoding if you are having trouble importing special characters.

In step 2 of a CSV import, you can specify an alternative delimiter if you aren't using a comma. WP All Import can import CSVs that are pipe-delimited, # delimited, or delimited/separated by any other character.

For CSV import tutorials and example files, visit our [documentation](http://www.wpallimport.com/documentation/?utm_source=free-plugin&utm_medium=dot-org&utm_campaign=documentation). Please keep in mind CSV imports with WP All Import are just like XML imports - you have all the same functionality, and the process is exactly the same. Any of our tutorial videos that apply to XML files also apply to importing CSV files, so if you see a tutorial with us importing an XML file, know that you can follow the exact same steps for a CSV import.
