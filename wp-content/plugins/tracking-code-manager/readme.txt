For every single service you use, you’ll have to put a script or a tracking pixel in the &lt;head&gt; or &lt;body&gt; tag of your WordPress site OR in some of its pages.

> <strong>TRACK CONVERSION ON YOUR E-COMMERCE PLUGIN</strong><br>
> When it comes to track conversions on a wordpress page it’s easy… but if it’s a "dynamic thank you page" is a big problem.<br><br>
> Tracking Code Manager plugin DETECT AUTOMATICALLY your e-commerce plugin (WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads or WP eCommerce) and let you put the conversion pixels every time someone completes a sale on your store.<br>
> In addition you also have the ability to track a single product at time ;)<br>

= THE REAL PROBLEM =

We are living in the SaaS era, where online services manage all kind of software, analysis and advanced tools. Since every one of them needs a script or a tracking code, why don’t we take it easy with the fast Tracking Code Manager plugin?

= FORGET THE UPDATING PROBLEM =

Putting the tracking code directly in the theme files, you risk to lose important trackings or external service integrations when it will be updated.

With Tracking Code Manager you can forget about this problem also if you will change your theme in the future.

= Will this plugin slow my website? =

Absolutely not! Since this plugin is built with lightweight code, you won’t notice any difference in speed.

= Can I put a tracking code or a script in ONE (maybe TWO?) specific page? =

Of course you can! You can choose to put the code in a single page, in some posts, or in the whole website (more features in PREMIUM version).

= Can I track conversions? =

Yeap! This is one of the main reason to use this plugin! You can track your conversions by putting the conversion pixel or code ONLY inside the thank you page.

= Can I manage Facebook Retargeting and Custom Audiences? =

Yes! For example you can put Facebook Pixel inside a certain posts of your blog to retarget those users who have already visited that posts on Facebook.

= Will this plugin interferes with my Google Analytics plugin? =

Nope! We tested the most famous Google Analytics plugins and it will not brake any of them.

= Can I use unlimited tracking codes and conversion pixels? =

You have 6 slots to use. Which means six different locations with unlimited tracking codes (enough for 99% of users).

= How to verify that a tracking code is properly working? =

Have a look at the source code of your page (search for: Tracking Code Manager) or you can install Google Chrome Addons. We suggest <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fb-pixel-helper/fdgfkebogiimcoedlicjlajpkdmockpc">FB Pixel Helper</a> for Facebook codes and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tag-assistant-by-google/kejbdjndbnbjgmefkgdddjlbokphdefk">Tag Assistant (by Google)</a> for Google codes.
