Map block for Gutenberg editor powered by Google Maps. Simple. Fast. Just a map block.


== Description ==
Are you using Gutenberg and need a map? This is the map block for you! Install, active, add to content. Done! No nonsense, no unneeded settings. Simple and clear in its function - as any Gutenberg block should be.

Gutenberg is now a core feature so please update to WordPress v5, or install the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/">Gutenberg plugin</a>.


= Plugin Features =

Works as any other Gutenberg block with the following settings:
* address, or coordinates
* zoom
* map height
* API key - once saved in one block it's used in all others


> Need a non-Gutenberg map solution? Check out our free <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-maps-widget/">Google Maps Widget</a> plugin.

For instruction on how to generate a Google Maps API key please read this <a href="https://www.gmapswidget.com/documentation/generate-google-maps-api-key/">article</a>.

== Installation ==

Standard stuff. Make sure you have the Gutenberg plugin installed, obviously.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Google Maps API key ... grrrr ... what where how!? =

Yes, yes, it's frustrating. See <a href="https://www.gmapswidget.com/documentation/generate-google-maps-api-key/">detailed instructions</a> from a similar plugin on how to get a map key.
