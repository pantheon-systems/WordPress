WP SES sends all outgoing WordPress emails through Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) for maximum email deliverability

== Description ==

The WP SES plugin has been acquired by [Delicious Brains Inc](https://deliciousbrains.com/?utm_campaign=WP%2BOffload%2BSES&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=free%2Bplugin%2Blisting). Big improvements are on the way, but for now we’ve just tidied up the UI a bit.

WP SES sends all outgoing WordPress emails through Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) instead of the local `wp_mail()` function.

This ensures high email deliverability, email traffic statistics and a powerful managed infrastructure.

Multisite features are so far experimental.

Current features are:

* Ability to adjust WordPress default sender email and name
* Validation of Amazon API credentials
* Request confirmation for sender emails
* Test message within Amazon Sandbox mode
* Full integration as seamless replacement for `wp_mail()` internal function
* Dashboard panel with quota and statistics
* Ability to customize return path for delivery failure notifications
* Custom Reply-To and From headers
* Default config values for centralized multisite setups
* SES region selection
* Emails with attachments are supported (Compatible with Contact Form 7)
* File logging feature (may be verbose and insecure, do not use as is in production for a long period of time)
* English, French, Spanish, Serbo-Croatian translations (fell free to send your mo/po files to support more languages)

**PRO Version with Email Support and More Features**

Get email open and click tracking for all your Amazon SES emails with the following features and more:

* Track email opens and link clicks
* Log sent emails and failures
* Queue email to handle rate limits and retry failures
* Step-by-step setup wizard encouraging best practices
* Email support

== Installation ==

= Basic Setup =

1. Install and activate the plugin
1. Go to Settings > WP SES in the WordPress dashboard menu
1. Fill the email address and name to use as the sender for all emails

= Amazon API Keys and Permissions =

1. Sign up for AWS if you haven't already
1. Visit the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)
1. Create a new IAM user or grant an existing user the following permissions: ListIdentities, SendEmail, SendRawEmail, VerifyEmailIdentity, DeleteIdentity, GetSendQuota, GetSendStatistics
1. In the plugin settings, fill in the Amazon API Keys

IAM User Inline Policy:

	{
	    "Version": "2012-10-17",
	    "Statement": [
	        {
	            "Sid": "Stmt1461433902000",
	            "Effect": "Allow",
	            "Action": [
	                "ses:DeleteIdentity",
	                "ses:GetSendQuota",
	                "ses:GetSendStatistics",
	                "ses:ListIdentities",
	                "ses:SendEmail",
	                "ses:SendRawEmail",
	                "ses:VerifyEmailIdentity"
	            ],
	            "Resource": [
	                "*"
	            ]
	        }
	    ]
	}

= Verify Sender Email Address =

Amazon SES requires that the sender of emails sent through its service confirm that they are the owners of the sender email address.

Email verification is per region, so **if you change regions, you will need to confirm your sender email address again.**

1. Visit the [Amazon SES console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/)
1. Verify the sender email address
1. Confirm by visiting the link you get by email from Amazon SES

= Sending a Test Email =

If this is the first time you're using Amazon SES, your account will be in sandbox mode, which means you can only send emails to the verified sender email address.

1. In the plugin settings, make sure to save changes (important!)
1. Scroll down and click the Send Test Email button

= Turning It On =

Once you get the test email working, you can send AWS a request to increase the sending limit and put your account in production mode, allowing you to send emails to anyone.

1. Visit the [Sending Statistics screen](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/#dashboard:) in the Amazon SES console
1. Click the *Request a Sending Limit Increase* button, fill out the form and submit
1. Once AWS grants your request, click the *Turn On* button in the plugin settings

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I get support for the plugin? =

If you upgrade to [WP Offload SES](https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-offload-ses/upgrade/?utm_campaign=WP%2BOffload%2BSES&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=free%2Bplugin%2Blistingee%2Bplugin%2Blisting), we will gladly provide you with email support. We take pride in delivering exceptional customer support. We do not provide email support for the free version.

= What are the minimum requirements? =

* WordPress 3.0+
* PHP 5 and cURL PHP extension
* MySQL 5.0+
* Apache 2+ or Nginx 1.4+
* Amazon Web Services account

= Can you help me about... (an Amazon concern) =

We are not otherwise linked to Amazon or Amazon Web Services.
Please direct your specific Amazon questions to Amazon support.

= How can I setup default values for a multisite install? =

Please test using the UI first, then if all works as expected, try using the following constants.

Edit the wp-config.php file and add any of the following constants:

	// AWS Access Key ID
	define('WP_SES_ACCESS_KEY','blablablakey');

	// AWS Secret Access Key
	define('WP_SES_SECRET_KEY','blablablasecret');

	// From mail (optional) must be an Amazon SES validated email
	// hard coded email, leave empty or comment out to allow custom setting via panel
	define('WP_SES_FROM','me@....');

	// Return path for bounced emails (optional)
	// hard coded email, leave empty or comment out to allow custom setting via panel
	define('WP_SES_RETURNPATH','return@....');

	// ReplyTo (optional) - This will get the replies from the recipients.
	// hard coded email, or 'headers' for using the 'replyto' from the headers.
	// Leave empty or comment out to allow custom setting via panel
	define('WP_SES_REPLYTO','headers');

	// Hide list of verified emails (optional)
	define('WP_SES_HIDE_VERIFIED',true);

	// Hide SES Stats panel (optional)
	define('WP_SES_HIDE_STATS',true);

	// Auto activate the plugin for all sites (optional)
	define('WP_SES_AUTOACTIVATE',true);

	When using defines to hardcode your setting, don't forget to define the SES endpoints, too :

	define('WP_SES_ENDPOINT', 'email.us-east-1.amazonaws.com');
	OR
	define('WP_SES_ENDPOINT', 'email.us-west-2.amazonaws.com');
	OR
	define('WP_SES_ENDPOINT', 'email.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com');

= How to do other actions on mail sent? =

I was asked to add a hook once mail is sent.
Could be used to log emails, or post email info to an API or database.

wpses_mailsent hook is available for that use.

In your code, define a callback function :

function myMailSentHook($to, $subject, $message, $headers, $attachments ) { ... }
// params are the same as the wp_mail() function.

// Then add your action :
add_action('wpses_mailsent','myMailSentHook',10,5);

= Can I create a translation for your plugin? =

Yes, please do! It's easy.

1. Visit [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org)
1. Choose your locale
1. Click on *Plugins*
1. Search for *wp ses*
1. Click on WP SES
1. Translate!

= I installed WP SES on my WP install and was able to get everything tested and the test emails work great. The only thing is I can’t get it to intercept the emails my contact form sends. They end up going through the normal SMTP route and not SES. This is the function for the mail: mail($to, $subject, $message, $header); =

Looks like your contact form uses the PHP `mail()` function instead of the WordPress `wp_mail()` function, so WP SES won’t be able to send the mail.

Please ask the plugin developer to change it to the following:

`wp_mail($to,$subject,$message,$header);`

= I used my ID and secret and repeatedly put them into WP SES, but it didn’t work, I also generated a new ID and secret too, but to no avail it still didn’t work. =

Did you use these keys before with another service (like S3), and if so, did they work with that service?

Did you sign up for the Amazon SES service?

Then, please inspectthe error message you get when trying to verify a sender address (at the top of the screen). This message should explain what is wrong with your keys (bad authentication, no SES subscription , etc.).
Amazon also requires that your server time is close enough to Amazon’s server time, so that might be worth checking as well.
