* **Add rules to filter data:** WP All Export Pro makes it easy to export the exact posts/products/orders you need. Want to export all WooCommerce orders over $100?

[Upgrade to the Pro edition of WP All Export.](http://www.wpallimport.com/upgrade-to-wp-all-export-pro/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=wordpress-dot-org-slash-wpae&utm_campaign=free+wp+all+export+plugin)

= Automatic Scheduling =

A new service from Soflyy, Automatic Scheduling provides a simple interface for setting exports to run on a schedule. The service will make sure that your exports start on time and that they successfully complete without the need to set up individual cron jobs. 

It costs $9/mo and can be used with WP All Export and WP All Import. You can set up as many exports and imports on as many sites as you like.

**What information is shared with Soflyy?** If you set an export to run on a schedule, WP All Export will open an encrypted connection to Soflyy servers. It will send the license key, site URL, ID of the export you want to run, export security key, and times that you want the export to run.

= WordPress CSV Exports =

A CSV is a very simple type of spreadsheet file where each column is separated by a comma. With WP All Export you can very easily set up a WordPress CSV export and control the order and title of the columns.

Very often you'll want to edit your data with Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers, or maybe something else. This is why a CSV export is so powerful - all spreadsheet software can read, edit, and save CSV files. WP All Export allows you edit your WordPress data using whatever spreadsheet software you are most comfortable with.

= WordPress XML Exports =

Sometimes you'll want to export your data so that some other tool, software, or service can use it. Very often they will require your data to be formatted as an XML file. XML is very similar to HTML, but you don't need to know anything about that in order to set up an XML export with WP All Export.

If you want to set up a WordPress XML export all you need to do is select 'XML' when configuring your export template. And just like a CSV export, an XML export will allow you to customize the element names and put them in any order you wish.
