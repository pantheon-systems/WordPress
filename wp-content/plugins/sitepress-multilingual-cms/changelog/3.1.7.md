# Features
* Added "Remote WPML config files" functionality
* Added shortcodes for language switchers
* Added template functions for reading/saving WPML settings, for future use
* Added various descriptions of WPML settings, displayed on configuration screens
* New version of installer
* When wp-admin language is switched to non default and user will update any plugin or theme configuration, this value will be recognized as translation and updated correctly

# Fixes
* Compatibility with WP 4.0: Removed like_escape()* calls
* Fixed broken relationship consistency when translating posts
* Fixed hreflang attribute for tag/category archive pages
* Fixed permissions checking for document translators
* Fixed url filters for different languages in different domains configured
* Fixed: media tags added to default language instead of translation
* get_custom_post_type_archive_link() now always returns correct link
* In icl_object_id we were checking if post type is registered: WordPress doesn't require this, so we removed this to be compatible with filters from other plugins
* Replaced strtolower() function calls with mb_strtolower() and gained better compatibility with non-ASCII languages
* WP SEO plugin compatibility enhancements
