# Features
* Added WPML capabilities (see online documentation)

# Fixes
* Fixed bug in slug translation when the slug is empty
* No more queries when translating strings from default String Translation language, when calling l18n functions (e.g. __(), _x(), etc.)
* Reduced the number of calls to *$sitepress->get_current_language()*, *$this->get_active_languages()* and *$this->get_default_language()*, to avoid running the same queries more times than needed
* Removed html escaping before sending strings to professional translation
