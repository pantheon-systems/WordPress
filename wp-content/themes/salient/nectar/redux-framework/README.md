## Getting Started with Redux ##

ReduxFramework has been built from the ground up to be the most flexible framework around. You can run it as an auto-updating plugin, or embed it inside your plugin or theme. It allows for multiple copies of itself within the same WordPress instance. For a guide on getting started please refer to [https://github.com/ReduxFramework/redux-framework/wiki/Getting-Started](https://github.com/ReduxFramework/redux-framework/wiki/Getting-Started).

You can also [download our sample theme available here](https://github.com/ReduxFramework/ReduxSampleTheme) to start developing right away.

## Please Post Reviews and Spread the Word ##

ReduxFramework has just released to the WordPress Plugins directory. Please spread the word, tweet, and (most importantly) post reviews on http://wordpress.org/plugins/redux-framework/.

## FAQs ##

1. Why should we use ```require_once``` instead of ```get_template_part```?
 * First, because ```get_template_part``` is for... you guessed it, themes! Redux is designed to work with both themes *and* plugins.
 * Second, read [this](http://kovshenin.com/2013/get_template_part/).
2. Why shouldn't we edit ```sample-config.php``` in the plugin directory?
 * Because ```sample-config.php``` will be replaced at each update of the plugin. You will lose all your effort

## Running PHP Unit tests ##

The tests are built using [wordpress's make subversion repository](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/automated-testing/)

`/var/www/wordpress-develop` as the destination for the core test files.
First download the wordress core tests repository, for these files.

```bash
cd /var/www
svn co http://develop.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/ wordpress-develop
```

In the newly created `/var/www/wordpress-develop` directory rename
`wp-tests-config-sample.php` to `wp-tests-config.php`. Now add your database
details to the new file:
```php
// WARNING WARNING WARNING!
// These tests will DROP ALL TABLES in the database with the prefix named below.
// DO NOT use a production database or one that is shared with something else.

define( 'DB_NAME', 'wordpress-tests' );
define( 'DB_USER', 'root' );
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'passowrd' );
define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' );
define( 'DB_CHARSET', 'utf8' );
define( 'DB_COLLATE', '' );
```
 - <b>n.b.</b> you may need to create the database first.
 - <b>n.b. n.b.</b> also note that the database used will be emptied on each run.

Set the `WP_TESTS_DIR` environment variable so that the `redux-framework` test bootstrap file can find the wordpress core tests:
```bash
export WP_TESTS_DIR='/var/www/wordpress-develop/tests/phpunit/includes/'
```

You should now be able to run the `redux-framework` unit tests:
```bash
redux-framework$ phpunit
